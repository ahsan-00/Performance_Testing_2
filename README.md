# Performance Testing on Banglapuzzle

This is a repository for Performance Testing of banglapuzzle.com. The purpose of this document is to provide information on how to set up and run performance tests for the website.

## Overview
Performance testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the performance of an application under different load conditions. It helps to identify how the application behaves in terms of speed, stability, and scalability. In this case I'm trying to check the performance of banglapuzzle.com. 
## Installing
To run performance tests, you will need to install the following tools:

- Apache JMeter
- Java JDK

Once you have installed the tools, clone the repository and open the JMeter file performance_test.jmx.
## Configuration
The JMeter file contains the following configurations that can be modified to suit your application's requirements:

- Thread Group: This defines the number of virtual users, the      ramp-up time, and the loop count.
- HTTP Request: This defines the URL and method of the request.
- Assertions: This defines the expected response time, error rate, and throughput.
## Execution

To execute the performance tests, follow these steps:

- Open the JMeter file performance_test.jmx.
- Click the "Run" button to start the test.
- Wait for the test to complete.
- Review the test results in the JMeter dashboard.
